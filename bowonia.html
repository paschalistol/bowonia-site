                <h2>The story</h2>
                <p>You are the last surviving Bowonian. A former citizen of the mighty city state of Bowonia. And the last remnants of the ancient guard has now fallen. Before the crisis, you were but a mere recruit. Now the fate of the world is in your hands. But how could you defeat an evil so great that not even the combined will- and might of your people could? Endless hordes of twisted UwUs will rush towards you, as they rip at your very flesh. Do they deserve mercy? NO! These creatures may look like you, but they are not of your kin. Treat them as they treated your people. Show them how it feels to be on the receiving end of Bowonian fury.</p>
